# Weed Classification

## Description

This repository contains code for a weed classification project using deep learning.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code:

* tensorflow
* keras
* opencv-python
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

## Usage

To use the code, first download the dataset from [link to dataset], then run the following command to train the model:

```python train_model.py``` 

After training the model, you can use the webcam.py script to classify live video from a webcam using the trained model:

```python webcam.py``` 

Note: The trained model file is too large to upload to GitHub and must be trained locally. My trained model con be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qspOtNQfYq_rHNzxoSaxZFjmYjreAzTr/view).
